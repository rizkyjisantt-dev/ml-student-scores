# Student Scores - Machine Learning Regression Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the **Student Scores** dataset using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, apply **Feature Engineering**, and build **Machine Learning Regression Models** to predict student scores based on various factors. The goal is to determine which model performs best in predicting student performance.

## 🚀 Steps in This Project
### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding the dataset
- Visualizing data distributions
- Identifying correlations between features

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Checking for **duplicated data**
- Handling **missing values**
- Performing **outlier analysis**

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Regression Modeling
We implement and compare two regression models:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
We evaluate model performance using key regression metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared Score (R²)**

### 5️⃣ Conclusion
After model evaluation, we determine which model provides the best performance for predicting student scores.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for analysis and modeling

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about students' study hours and their corresponding scores.
